Floor Is Lava:
--------------
A Minecraft Spigot Plugin that kills players that stand on any non-manually
placed blocks. Exempts blocks that players spawn on/the block that players
are standing on when the plugin is activated. Written for Spigot 1.16.4 API.

This is a recreation of the plugin used in 
[GeorgeNotFound's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17HqO9O_w54).

Installation:
-------------
Place FloorIsLava.jar in the Spigot plugins folder.
When the server starts, the plugin's main functions will be deactivated
so no blocks will kill the player (within this plugin's control). To
activate the plugin, use the command: `/floorislava on`. To deactivate
the plugin, use the command: `/floorislava off`.
